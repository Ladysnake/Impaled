# Impaled - Changelog:

### Impaled 1.1 - 1.18.1
- Removed the heated Hellfork
- Introduced an alternative to it: the Soulfork
  - Use a Hellfork on a soul campfire, soul lantern or soul torch to turn the Hellfork in a Soulfork and the soul block used into its normal fire variant
    - Use a Soulfork on a campfire, lantern or torch to turn the Soulfork back into a Hellfork and the block used back into its soul fire variant
  - The Soulfork consumes one level of experience per Riptide use
    - If the user has less than one level of experience, they will receive 2 points of damage that bypasses armor and protection
  - Using the Soulfork to riptide will put the user on fire while not damaging them (if the user was not already on fire)
- Using a Hellfork or Soulfork to riptide while on fire will no longer render the fire overlay for the user
- Fixed players being able to duplicate Elder Tridents by riptiding into a wall and picking up the guardian tridents spawned

### Impaled 1.0.3 - 1.18.1
Introduces heated Hellfork balance changes:
- Heated Hellforks will no longer put their user on fire when held. No more awkward hotbar (haha) scrolls that put you on fire!
- Heated Hellforks with Riptide will now deal 2 (1 heart) damage upon use if the user is not already on fire. This damage bypasses armor and Protection enchantments, but can be avoided if the user has the fire resistance effect.

### Impaled 1.0.1 - 1.17
